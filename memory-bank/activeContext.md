## Current Work Focus

**Memory Bank Status**: Complete refresh of all memory bank files completed (January 20, 2025). All documentation is current and reflects the mature state of the Muse project - a production-ready Go-based CLI tool for AI-powered Git commit message generation.

**Project Status**: Beta/Pre-release phase with core functionality complete and ready for production testing. OpenAI integration is production-ready, with a well-architected foundation prepared for additional LLM providers. The project has a comprehensive understanding of its architecture, dependencies, and roadmap.

**Current Development Phase**: Ready for next development cycle focusing on provider expansion (Anthropic Claude, Ollama), user experience improvements, and preparing for broader distribution through package managers.

## Recent Changes

- ✅ **productContext.md**: Detailed problem statement, business rationale, user personas, and complete user experience goals
- ✅ **systemPatterns.md**: Comprehensive architecture documentation including component relationships, design patterns, and critical implementation paths
- ✅ **techContext.md**: Complete technology stack documentation, dependencies, constraints, and development setup patterns
- ✅ **progress.md**: Current status, comprehensive accomplishments list, known issues, and detailed evolution of project decisions
- ✅ **activeContext.md**: Updated current work focus and consolidated project insights (this file)

**Memory Bank Quality**: All files are now comprehensive, consistent, and ready to support effective development handoffs and context preservation across development sessions.

### Core Infrastructure (Recent Accomplishments)

- Completed CLI application structure using urfave/cli framework
- Implemented hierarchical configuration system with koanf
- Built extensible LLM provider architecture with OpenAI implementation
- Created dynamic template system supporting multiple commit styles
- Established Git hook integration with prepare-commit-msg hook

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities (Next Sprint)

1. **Provider Expansion**: Implement Anthropic Claude provider following established provider pattern
2. **Error Handling Enhancement**: Improve error messages, resilience, and fallback mechanisms for better user experience
3. **Testing Suite Expansion**: Add comprehensive integration tests for Git hook functionality and provider interactions
4. **User Documentation**: Create installation guides, configuration reference, and troubleshooting documentation

### Short-term Goals (1-2 Months)

1. **Ollama Integration**: Add local model support for offline usage and privacy-conscious environments
2. **Performance Optimization**: Improve handling of large Git diffs and API timeout management
3. **Cross-Platform Validation**: Ensure reliable operation on Windows, macOS, and Linux through automated testing
4. **Distribution Pipeline**: Prepare package manager support (Homebrew, apt, Chocolatey) and automated release workflows

### Medium-term Goals (3-6 Months)

1. **Context Intelligence**: Repository-aware commit message generation with historical pattern learning
2. **Custom Template System**: User-defined commit message templates with validation
3. **Team Collaboration Features**: Shared configurations, organizational standards, and policy enforcement
4. **Enterprise Integration**: Azure OpenAI support, SSO authentication, and audit logging

### Long-term Vision (6+ Months)

1. **Plugin Ecosystem**: Dynamic provider loading and community-contributed extensions
2. **Advanced Analytics**: Commit pattern analysis and code quality insights
3. **IDE Integration**: VS Code, IntelliJ, and other IDE extensions
4. **CI/CD Integration**: Automated commit message validation and policy enforcement

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Provider Strategy

- **Decision**: Prioritize Anthropic Claude as second provider
- **Rationale**: High-quality responses and growing developer adoption
- **Consideration**: Balance cloud vs local provider development effort

### User Experience Philosophy

- **Decision**: Maintain user control over all generated content
- **Rationale**: Trust and transparency are critical for Git workflow integration
- **Consideration**: Preview and edit capabilities vs automation efficiency

### Architecture Approach

- **Decision**: Keep provider interface simple and focused
- **Rationale**: Easier to implement new providers and maintain consistency
- **Consideration**: Feature-specific extensions vs universal interface

### Configuration Strategy

- **Decision**: Environment variables for sensitive data, YAML for configuration
- **Rationale**: Security best practices while maintaining usability
- **Consideration**: Team shared configs vs individual developer preferences

## Important Patterns & Preferences

### Code Organization Patterns

- **Provider Pattern**: Clean abstraction for multiple LLM services
- **Registry Pattern**: Dynamic provider registration and discovery
- **Template Method**: Consistent structure across different commit styles
- **Builder Pattern**: Flexible configuration and CLI command construction

### Development Practices

- **Go Idioms**: Follow standard Go patterns and conventions
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation without breaking Git workflow
- **Single Binary**: No external dependencies for end-user installation
- **Cross-Platform**: Native support for major operating systems

### User Interaction Philosophy

- **Non-Intrusive**: Integrate seamlessly into existing Git workflows
- **Transparent**: Always show generated content before application
- **Configurable**: Support team standards while allowing individual preferences
- **Reliable**: Fail safely without disrupting Git operations

### Security Practices

- **API Key Management**: Environment variables preferred over config files
- **Input Validation**: Sanitize all external inputs before processing
- **Output Validation**: Validate LLM responses before Git integration
- **Minimal Permissions**: Run with user context and repository permissions only

## Project Insights & Learnings

### Technical Insights

- **Go Ecosystem**: Excellent for CLI tools with rich library support and cross-platform builds
- **Git Hook Integration**: prepare-commit-msg provides perfect integration point for commit message generation
- **LLM APIs**: Structured outputs with JSON schema significantly improve response quality and consistency
- **Configuration Hierarchy**: Multiple config sources provide flexibility while maintaining predictable behavior

### User Experience Learnings

- **Developer Trust**: Users need control and transparency in automated Git tools
- **Setup Friction**: Initial configuration must be simple to encourage adoption
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful degradation is more important than perfect AI responses
- **Workflow Integration**: Tool should feel like natural extension of Git, not separate system

### Architecture Insights

- **Provider Abstraction**: Early abstraction investment pays off for multi-provider support
- **Template Engine**: Dynamic template compilation enables flexible commit styles without code changes
- **JSON Schema**: Structured validation improves reliability and enables better error handling
- **Stateless Design**: Each commit message generation should be independent for reliability

### Market and Adoption Insights

- **Individual Developers**: Strong interest in reducing commit message friction
- **Team Adoption**: Standardization benefits outweigh initial setup costs
- **Enterprise Potential**: Compliance and auditing benefits drive organizational interest
- **Open Source**: Community-driven development model suits developer tool market

### Development Process Learnings

- **Beta Testing**: Core functionality stability enables broader testing and feedback
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive memory bank enables efficient context switching and collaboration
- **Provider Priority**: Starting with single provider enables solid architecture foundation
- **User Feedback**: Direct user testing reveals UX issues not apparent in isolated development

### Future Considerations

- **Local vs Cloud**: Balance between AI quality and privacy/offline requirements
- **Customization**: Support team-specific conventions without overwhelming complexity
- **Integration**: Potential integrations with issue tracking, code review, and CI/CD systems
- **Scaling**: Architecture ready for enterprise features and team management capabilities

### Success Metrics

- **Adoption**: Individual developer usage and team rollouts
- **Quality**: Commit message consistency and developer satisfaction
- **Reliability**: Hook execution stability and error recovery
- **Extensibility**: Ease of adding new providers and features
