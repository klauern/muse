Analyze the following git diff and generate a conventional commit message:

```
{{.Diff}}
```

The commit message should follow this format:
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]

Where:
- <type> is one of: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore, etc.
- <scope> is optional and represents the module affected; generally small (deps, ci, etc)
- <description> is a short summary in the present tense
- <body> provides additional context (optional)
- <footer> mentions any breaking changes or closed issues (optional)

Please generate a commit message following this format.

The response should be a valid JSON object matching this schema:
{{.Schema}}
