Analyze the following git diff and generate a gitmoji commit message:

```
{{.Diff}}
```

The commit message should follow this format:
<gitmoji> <type>[optional scope]: <subject>

<body>

<footer>

Where:
- <gitmoji> is an appropriate emoji for the change (e.g., 🐛 for bug fixes, ✨ for new features)
- <type> is one of: feat (✨), fix (🐛), docs (📝), style (💄), refactor (♻️), test (✅), chore (🔧), etc.
- <scope> is optional and represents the module affected; generally small (deps, ci, etc)
- <subject> is a short description in the present tense
- <body> provides additional context (optional)
- <footer> mentions any breaking changes or closed issues (optional)

Please generate a commit message following this format, choosing an appropriate gitmoji.

The response should be a valid JSON object matching this schema:
{{.Schema}}
